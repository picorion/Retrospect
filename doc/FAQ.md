# FAQ

*Keep in mind that the form of the requestable data could, of course, change over time, resulting in discrepancies or errors.*

*All code is currently based on data from the beginning of 2021.*

## General

### Can I import multiple usage data folders?

> Yes.
> The import process will also ignore duplicate data.

### How does Retrospect process the data?

> Your data gets only processed locally on your machine.
> The files in the folder are only imported temporarily and are not changed. If the program gets closed,
> the imported data gets "forgotten".

### Why does some of the data presented differ from Spotify Rewind or others?

> As far as I could determine, podcasts, for example, are considered differently than songs in the total listening time.
> Overall, of course, the calculation of values can vary, with large amounts of data,
> even deviating rounding can make a big difference. Nevertheless,
> it was tried to design the calculations so that values do not deviate too much.

### Why are files listed as missing?

> Not all Spotify user information is included in the extended data ("FamilyPlan", "Identity" and "Userdata".
> However, this is not a problem, only the "Your Data" tab will not show any info.
> To display the user data, a simple request via the [Spotify Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/de/account/privacy/) is enough to get the usual data.

## Extended Usage Data

### What is the difference to the usual usage data?

> The usual usage data contains only the last year's playbacks. The extended data,
> which must be requested separately by mail, contains all previous playbacks,
> devices used and distinguishes between songs and podcasts. However, user data such as address,
> profile picture, etc. are only included with the usual data.

### Why are there differences to the usual data?

> It looks like some more playbacks are included with the extended data, unfortunately I have no explanation for this.
> However, the differences should not be too noticeable and are due to the data provided.
